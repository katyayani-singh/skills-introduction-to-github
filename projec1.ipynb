            "\n",
            "* **Menu and Pricing:**  The addition of a `menu` dictionary  (even a simple one) is crucial for a restaurant order assistant.  This allows you to:\n",
            "    * Display prices.\n",
            "    * Calculate a total bill.\n",
            "    * Handle items not on the menu (as shown in the display).\n",
            "* **Error Handling:** The `try-except` block in `get_order` now catches `ValueError` if the user enters non-numeric input for the quantity.  It also includes a check to ensure that the quantity is a positive number.  This is VERY important for robustness.\n",
            "* **Order Confirmation:**  The `confirm_order` function provides a proper confirmation loop, preventing accidental order submissions.\n",
            "* **`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`**:  This is the standard Python idiom for making sure that the `main` function is only called when the script is executed directly (not when it's imported as a module).\n",
            "* **Clearer Prompts and Output:**  Improved prompts for the user to guide them through the ordering process. The `display_order` formatting has been improved, and it handles cases where an item might not be on the menu.\n",
            "* **Lowercase Conversion:** The `item = input(...).lower()` makes the chatbot case-insensitive, so the user can enter \"Burger\", \"burger\", or \"BURGER\".\n",
            "* **Comments:**  More comments to explain the different parts of the code.\n",
            "* **Price Formatting:** Uses f-strings and `:.2f` to format prices with two decimal places.\n",
            "* **Handles empty orders:** If the user enters 'done' immediately, the order is cancelled, and a \"Your order is empty\" message is displayed.\n",
            "\n",
            "How to run this code:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `restaurant_chatbot.py`).\n",
            "2.  **Run:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the script using: `python restaurant_chatbot.py`\n",
            "3.  **Interact:**  The chatbot will then prompt you to enter items and quantities.\n",
            "\n",
            "This improved example is much more robust and provides a solid foundation for a restaurant ordering assistant.  Remember that this is still a basic example. You can expand on it by:\n",
            "\n",
            "*   Adding more sophisticated menu management (reading from a file, database).\n",
            "*   Integrating with a payment gateway.\n",
            "*   Adding delivery options.\n",
            "*   Using a GUI library (like Tkinter or PyQt) for a more user-friendly interface.\n",
            "*   Implementing natural language processing (NLP) to handle more complex user input.\n",

            "Key improvements and explanations:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **`if __name__ == \"__main__\":`**:  This is crucial. It ensures that the `library_chatbot()` function is only called when you run the script directly (e.g., `python your_script_name.py`), and not when you import it as a module into another script.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Lowercase Conversion:**  `query = input(\"> \").lower()` converts the user's input to lowercase.  This makes the chatbot much more robust, as it can handle input like \"Book\", \"BOOK\", or \"book\" equally well.  This is similarly done for book and author lookups.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Book Title Capitalization:** `book_title.title()` now displays the book title with the first letter of each word capitalized, for better readability.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Clearer Prompts:**  Prompts are now more informative, guiding the user on what to enter.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Static Data (Replace with Database):**  The `book_data` and `author_books` dictionaries are placeholders.  In a real-world application, you would replace these with a connection to a proper library database (like SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL).  This example clearly highlights where that replacement would occur.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Availability Check:** The `book_data` dictionary now includes `availability` information.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Error Handling:** The chatbot now provides a more helpful error message if the user enters a book or author that is not in the (static) database.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Exit/Quit Functionality:** The chatbot can now be exited gracefully with \"exit\", \"quit\", or \"bye\".\n",
            "\n",
            "* **`while True:` Loop:** The chatbot continues to ask for input until the user types \"exit\", \"quit\", or \"bye\".\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Clear Instructions and `Help` Message:** The default `else` condition provides a short help message so the user knows what kind of questions the chatbot can answer.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **More Natural Greetings and Farewells:** Includes basic greetings and \"thank you\" responses.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Comments:**  Includes comments to explain the code.\n",
            "\n",
            "How to run the code:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `library_chatbot.py`).\n",
            "2.  Open a terminal or command prompt.\n",
            "3.  Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\n",
            "4.  Run the script using `python library_chatbot.py`.\n",
            "\n",
            "This improved version is much more functional and provides a better foundation for building a more sophisticated library chatbot.  Remember to replace the static data with a database connection for real-world use.\n",
